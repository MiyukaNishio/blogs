[#mp7]
== Develop your microservice applications with MicroProfile 7.0

MicroProfile provides a set of APIs and tools for developing, deploying, and managing microservices in a lightweight and efficient manner. The 24.0.0.12 release adds support for the MicroProfile programming model version 7.0, a major release. It replaces MicroProfile Metrics with MicroProfile Telemetry. Therefore, MicroProfile Metrics moves out of the umbrella release and becomes a stand-alone specification. This release also introduces the new versions of the MicroProfile OpenAPI, Rest Client, Fault Tolerance, and Telemetry features. For more information, see link:{url-prefix}/blog/2024/12/03/microprofile-7.html[MicroProfile 7.0 deep dive with Open Liberty].

[#samesite]
== Check for Samesite=None incompatible clients

In 24.0.0.12, you can now use `SameSite=None` cookies without the worry of breaking certain client versions. Previously, cookies with the `SameSite=None` attribute were rejected or mishandled (treated as `SameSite=Strict`) if they were sent to an link:https://www.chromium.org/updates/same-site/incompatible-clients/[incompatible client version]. Now, Open Liberty intercepts cookies with the `SameSite=None` attribute before they are sent to the web browser and checks if the `User-Agent` specifies an incompatible client version. If an incompatible client is detected, the `SameSite=None` and `Partitioned` headers (if present) are removed from the cookie.

For more information, see link:{url-prefix}/blog/2020/03/25/set-samesite-attribute-cookies-liberty.html[Setting the SameSite attribute on cookies with Open Liberty].
